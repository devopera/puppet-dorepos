Changelog
---------

2014-01-15

  * replaced nested $repo with $repo_X vars to handle defaults properly

2013-10-16

  * getrepo doesn't automatically force submodules on to their master branch, but installapp would if its $repo were not overridden

2013-10-04

  * stopped forcing permissions by default on checked out shell scripts to +x, because git stores exec permissions in the repo

2013-09-20

  * dorepos::installapp can now install apps with their own cron tasks.  By default install_crontabs = false, but it can be set using a resource collector or resource default if you have some kind of cron/automate profile.

2013-09-17

  * by default, when checking out a repo with submodules, put all submodules on to their master branch

2013-08-26

  * added symlinkdir feature to allow installed repos to put a symlink in another named folder, such as the user's home directory

2013-06-20

  * git pull now does a git submodule update too

2013-05-17

  * Changed \; to \\; as puppet recognised former as incorrect escaping
