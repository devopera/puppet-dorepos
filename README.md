Changelog
---------

2015-06-20

  * Can turn off vhosts so that installapp won't install them; useful if your vhost contains SSL cert references that don't exist.

2014-12-17

  * Added copyout with arbitrary substitution to installapp

2014-11-25

  * Fixed find bug by removing deprecated -h flag, replaced with -name

2014-06-04

  * SELinux port handling with docommon::seport

2014-05-05

  * added non-standard port handling to installapp

2014-01-15

  * replaced nested $repo with $repo_X vars to handle defaults properly

2013-10-16

  * getrepo doesn't automatically force submodules on to their master branch, but installapp would if its $repo were not overridden

2013-10-04

  * stopped forcing permissions by default on checked out shell scripts to +x, because git stores exec permissions in the repo

2013-09-20

  * dorepos::installapp can now install apps with their own cron tasks.  By default install_crontabs = false, but it can be set using a resource collector or resource default if you have some kind of cron/automate profile.

2013-09-17

  * by default, when checking out a repo with submodules, put all submodules on to their master branch

2013-08-26

  * added symlinkdir feature to allow installed repos to put a symlink in another named folder, such as the user's home directory

2013-06-20

  * git pull now does a git submodule update too

2013-05-17

  * Changed \; to \\; as puppet recognised former as incorrect escaping

Usage
-----

Setup dorepos, initially with an empty list of repositories (no repos checked out)

    class { 'dorepos' :
      user => 'web',
      user_git_name => 'devopera',
      user_git_email => 'devopera@example.com',
      require => [Class['dopki'], Class['dopki::sshagentadd']],
    }

After setup, checkout a repo

    dorepos::getrepo { 'devopera-docommon-puppet-repo':
      user => 'web',
      provider => 'git',
      path => '/var/www/git/github.com',
      source => 'git@github.com:devopera/puppet-docommon.git',
      require => [Class['dorepos'], File['/var/www/git/github.com/']],
    }
